    <h2><u>The Dish:</u></h2>
    <p>
        Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made with layers of wide, flat pasta noodles, meat or vegetables, and cheese, all baked together in a casserole dish. The pasta noodles are usually cooked in advance, and then layered with the other ingredients and a sauce, such as a meat or tomato sauce, in a baking dish. The dish is then baked in the oven until the cheese is melted and bubbly, and the lasagna is heated through. Lasagna is a popular choice for a hearty, satisfying meal and can be made with a variety of ingredients to suit different tastes. It is often served hot, and can be accompanied by a salad or other side dishes.

    <li>
        To begin, preheat your oven to 350°F (180°C). In a large saucepan, cook the ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until the beef is browned and the vegetables are tender. Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, diced tomatoes, basil, oregano, salt, and pepper. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 20 minutes.

        In a separate bowl, mix together the ricotta cheese, egg, and Parmesan cheese. Stir in the spinach.

        To assemble the lasagna, spread a layer of the meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Top with a layer of lasagna noodles, then a layer of the cheese mixture. Repeat the layers, ending with a layer of meat sauce. Top with the mozzarella cheese. Cover the dish with foil and bake for 45 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 15 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly. Allow the lasagna to cool for a few minutes before serving. Enjoy!

    <h2>The Dish</h2>
    <p>
        Pork tenderloin is a lean, tender cut of pork that comes from the muscle that runs along the backbone of the pig. It is usually sold as a long, thin piece of meat, and it is generally very lean and tender, making it a popular choice for grilling, roasting, and pan-frying. Pork tenderloin can be prepared in a variety of ways, such as marinated and grilled, breaded and pan-fried, or roasted with vegetables. It can also be sliced and used in dishes like stir-fries or sandwiches. Because it is lean, it is important not to overcook pork tenderloin, as it can become dry and tough if cooked for too long. It is typically cooked to an internal temperature of 145°F (63°C) and allowed to rest for a few minutes before serving

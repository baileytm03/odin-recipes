   <h2>The Dish</h2>
    <p>
        Tater tots are a popular snack or side dish made from grated potatoes that are formed into small cylinders and deep-fried until crispy and golden brown. They are typically served hot and are often paired with dips such as ketchup or ranch dressing. Tater tots are often associated with American cuisine and are a common menu item at fast food restaurants and school cafeterias. They can also be found in the frozen food section of many supermarkets and can be easily prepared at home by baking or frying frozen tater tots according to the package instructions. Tater tots are a convenient and tasty way to add a bit of crunch to a meal or snack.
